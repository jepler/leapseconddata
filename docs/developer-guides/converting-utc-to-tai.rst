Converting a UTC date and time to TAI
=====================================

.. py:currentmodule:: leapseconddata

In order to convert a UTC date and time to TAI, you must first
obtain the leap second data by using one of the methods described
in :ref:`devguide-obtaining-leaps`. Then, you can use the
:py:meth:`LeapSecondData.to_tai` method to convert the date and time.

For example:

.. literalinclude:: convert-utc-to-tai.py

This program will provide you with the following output:

.. literalinclude:: convert-utc-to-tai.py.exp
